## Too Much

Add too much YAN - rapid fermentation which causes fusel alcohols, jet-fuel taste (what are fusel alcohols?). Can also cause ethyl carbamate, which is shown to be carcinogenic (effect size?). Can too much Fermaid O, as stated på Scott Labs, can cause yeasty flavors.

Too much can also feed spoiling microbes -- or maybe not ref Scott Lab's Nichola Hall (what are examples of spoiling microbes?).

## How much to Add

Scott Labs Fermentation Handbook formula:

For Extra Low N requiring strains: Sugar (g/L) x 0.5
For Low N requiring strains: Sugar (g/L) x 0.75
For Medium N requiring strains: Sugar (g/L) x 0.90
For High N requiring strains: Sugar (g/L) x 1.25

Get Sugar g/L from specific gravity of must.

## Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA)

Typical take:

Rehydrate yeast with GoFerm and pitch, then degass/oxygenate and add half Fermaid O after 24h, then repeate after 24h. This will ensure a good growth periode.
