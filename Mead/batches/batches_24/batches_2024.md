Aeration, turbulent pour twice between buckes before adding yeast, after lacto-ferment
Off with lid + relid and shake for 1 min, 4 days after pitch

Notes:
After lacto-ferment, smell of silo and wet grass. Tasted not sour, but funky. Very sweet. Overall interesting but unappealing.
Smell pungent, musty and grass-like after 4 days. Smell almost suspicious. Taste clearly sour, funkyness more balances, taste is pleasing.

Would not referment to get carbonation. Hypothesis: Fermentation stalled for too long, and the yeast died/hibernated. The introduction of some dextrose did not restart it.

Taste was interesting, but not for beginners. Strong and funky. Why? Think it was because it fermented hot, and high honey concentration.
